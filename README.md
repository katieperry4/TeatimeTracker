This is a tea-tracking application! I drink astronomical amounts of tea, and sometimes I wonder just how much I drink. 
Which type is my favorite?
What are my total cups of tea?
How much caffeine am I consuming on a daily basis?

I wanted these questions answered in a way that was easy for me to add a cup of tea, but also look cute.

## Visuals 
This is what some of the application looks like

## Technologies
I wrote this app in Visual Studio using ASP.NET Core MVC, Identity, and SQLServer Express. 
It's published using Azure AppService, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Server.

## If you want to run this app locally
Go for it! I recommend using Visual Studio and SQL Server of some form. Make sure to replace the connection string in appsettings.json
Delete any migrations besides the one auto-generated by Identity. Use "dotnet ef database update" in the developer console.
Then make a new migration using "dotnet ef migrations add migration-name" and run "dotnet ef database update" again.
The database will automatically seed with the tea types and tea variety data from the "SeedData.cs" file.

## Roadmap
There is a lot I could add to this application. 
I can already see that I'm going to have some issues with the reports generating a very extremely long list. 
So at some point, I'd like to add pagination for the reports.

I'd also like to make the recommendation service a little more complicated. 
Right now it takes the server time and the logged-in user's caffeine intake and recommends a tea based on that.
-> if it's too late in the day or they've had a lot of caffeine it only recommends herbal teas.
